    <p>Let's start with the Ingredients!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>block halloumi cheese</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4 brioche buns</li>
        <li>4 tbsp hummus</li>
        <li>1 large ripe tomato</li>
        <li>4 Butterhead lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>4 tbsp fresh tomato salsa</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now that you know what we need, let's start!</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a barbecue until the coals are glowing white hot. Brush each side of all the halloumi slices with olive oil and cook them on each side for 2-3 mins or until golden.</li>
        <li>Split the brioche buns (toast them very briefly on both sides if you like, but be careful not to burn them) and spread the bottom halves with the hummus. Add some tomato and then the halloumi, then finish with the lettuce and salsa and top with the other half of the bun.</li>
    </ol>
